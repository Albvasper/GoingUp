# 🧗‍♂️ Going Up!

Going Up! is a 3D platformer where the player must climb a tall building with precise platforming. One wrong step can send you all the way back to the start—think of it as a vertical challenge that tests patience and skill.

## 🎮 Project Summary

This game was developed as a two-person collaboration between a programmer (me) and a 3D artist. It features physics-based platforming, minimal UI, and a tight gameplay loop that encourages mastery through repetition.

## 💻 My Contributions

* Programmed all game systems in Unity using C#

* Designed and implemented player movement and jumping physics

* Created UI elements such as the pause menu and respawn logic

* Built event triggers for checkpoints, game state handling, and player feedback


## 📄 Key Scripts
