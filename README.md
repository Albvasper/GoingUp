#  Going Up!

Going Up! is a 3D platformer where the player must climb a tall building with precise platforming. One wrong step can send you all the way back to the start—think of it as a vertical challenge that tests patience and skill.

## Project Summary

This game was developed as a two-person collaboration between a programmer (me) and a 3D artist. It features physics-based platforming, minimal UI, and a tight gameplay loop that encourages mastery through repetition.

## My Contributions

* Developed all core gameplay systems in Unity using C#, including movement, game state handling, and event logic.

* Implemented responsive player movement and jump physics to ensure tight and satisfying controls.

* Designed and programmed in-game UI elements such as the main menu.

* Built trigger-based event systems for interactive feedback and level progression.


## Key Scripts

- [PlayerMovement.cs](https://github.com/Albvasper/GoingUp/blob/main/Going%20Up/Assets/Scripts/new/PlayerMovement.cs) – Handles player movement, jumping, and falling behavior.
- [PlayerCamera.cs](https://github.com/Albvasper/GoingUp/blob/main/Going%20Up/Assets/Scripts/new/PlayerCamera.cs) – Manages Player camera.
